        <hr>
        <p>Hi, I'm Abbi. I'm a writing, reading, language, creation--anything imaginative--enthusiast. 
            Having a vivid imagination is wonderful (especially when I overthink things and come up with insane 
            scenarios in my head) but it doesn't always get you paid. Enter web development. My plan is to hone 
            said writing and creative skills with the experience I gain at Georgia Tech to construct a career for 
            myself. My hope is that I can, at least: keep up with this ever-advancing world, and 
            at best: change it for the better.
        </p>
